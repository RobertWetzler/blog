Adding images to your Hugo blog is simple!

## Step 1: Add Your Images

Put your images in the `static/images/` folder:

```
hugo-blog-demo/
├── static/
│   └── images/
│       ├── photo1.jpg
│       └── photo2.png
```

## Step 2: Reference in Markdown

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/photo1.jpg)
```

## Step 3: That's It!

No uploading to a CMS, no waiting for processing. Just files.
