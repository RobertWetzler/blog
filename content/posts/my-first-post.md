# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first post using Hugo. It's incredibly simple:

1. Write content in **Markdown**
2. Add images to the `static/` folder
3. Run `hugo server` to preview
4. Run `hugo` to build for production

## Adding Images

Just put images in the `static/images/` folder and reference them like this:

![My Image](/images/example.jpg)

## Code Blocks

Hugo supports syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, Hugo!")
```

That's it! No complicated CMS, just simple files.
